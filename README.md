## 💡 About the Project

**SafePath AI** is an AI-powered safety navigation platform that empowers women to travel through cities with confidence. It goes beyond panic buttons or reactive alerts—by predicting risks, recommending safe routes, and enabling community travel options.

> 👩‍💻 Built for the EmpowerHer AI Hackathon, this is a project that fuses **AI**, **urban analytics**, and **ethical design** to create safer public environments.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🗺️ **Dynamic Safety Heatmaps**  
  Visual overlays combining crime data, lighting, surveillance, and crowdsourced sentiment.

- ⚠️ **Predictive Harassment Alerts**  
  Uses time, location, and context (e.g., weather, events) to anticipate risks before they happen.

- 🚌 **Public Transport Safety Audit**  
  Occupancy rates, gender ratios, and safest spots for buses & metro.

- 🤝 **SafeZone Buddy Network**  
  Anonymous, verified coordination of safe group travel via chatbot.

- 📊 **Visual Safety Reports**  
  Real-time analytics and personalized safety scores for any location.

## 📈 How It Works

1. **Data Fusion**: Combines simulated urban datasets like crime logs, streetlight/CCTV density, transit stats, and user sentiment.
2. **AI Modeling**: Calculates safety scores using spatial-temporal ML models and heuristics.
3. **Routing Engine**: Recommends safest paths, even if they aren’t shortest.
4. **Community Layer**: SafeZone buddy match for verified co-travelers.

## 🌍 Use Cases

- Solo women commuters navigating unfamiliar areas
- Citizens traveling late night or during events
- Urban planners visualizing safety coverage
- NGOs building community-based safety networks

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- ⏱️ Real-time data APIs (weather, transit, events)  
- 🎙️ Voice input & multilingual support  
- 📱 Mobile-first design and wearable integration  
- 🛑 Bias-aware decision engine and ethical safeguards
